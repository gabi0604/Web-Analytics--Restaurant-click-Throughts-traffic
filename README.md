# Summary:
Https://absindianrestuarant.yolasite.com/ is one of the food blogging and Restaurant based websites. Which also has recipes and specialties that belong to the various regions across India. This website is about Indian diners and blogging, it also contains local desserts, because even though the food tastes good, we must meet the food preference according to the region. So, we have added local sweet delicacies. This website consists of 3 pages that describe blogging, the main page, and the contact us page. As the main page is about the content creator. I just want to make sure my visitors have simple navigation throughout the website. This page shows and navigates the other page tags and a brief introduction about this website. The layout of the page has different events and goals associated with it. On the first page, it has the download link for downloading the menu at the middle of the page, and, the bento box is for navigating the different delivery options as per the location and E-commerce websites available. Here we can find different food at reasonable prices to buy. The second page consists location, date, and details of the website and Restaurant manager. Finally, if the person is a first-time user, then they can give you feedback and fill the form with the user details like First name and last name. If they would like to see more on my website, they can use this form on the Contact Us page.
By using Google Analytics, we can track events and goals such as downloads and page scrolls. We can find out if the person is a first-time user or not. In the event track section, we can also find customers who are reusing the website and backtracking. It can even track users' clicks on the hyperlink. The goal conversion will show the user page visiting the site and, funnels that I have set up will help the user to navigate exactly where the user exits the site. As per Google Analytics, Currently Website has 173 visitors with a Bounce rate of 4.82%, and those who have visited the site through either Social media or search engines. I have placed 11 goals in total on my site that contains events of different categories. Following this trend, I have 30 returning users and 130 new visitors on average per month and, I think It would increase in the upcoming month.

# Analysis:
## Baseline forecasting model:
To understand traffic and for predicting we use forecasting models in this I have developed 3 different types of models for the next 2 months. that could depict trends in Baseline, optimistic, and pessimistic Forecasting models. For the baseline model, I assumed that new visitors would increase by 10% per month, and in the returning users I have assumed it would be 30% per month (losing returning users) and 20% of Non-bounced new visitors would be returning (after taking the bounce rate from the sessions). From the graph below, we can see that new visitors have increased from 120 to 132 approximately and returning visitors from 30 to 46 in the second month. In the 3rd month, I gained new visitors around 158 with a return visitors of 61. The below graph illustrates the Baseline forecasting model, which could find trends of new and returning visitors.

In this model, we successfully predicted the efficiency of future traffic using the Optimistic Forecasting model. For this, I assumed that my new visitors would increase by 15% per month, and in the returning users I assumed it would be 20% per month and 25% of Non-bounced new visitors would be returning (after taking the bounce rate from the sessions). From the graph below, we can see that new visitors have increased from 120 to 138 and returning visitors from 30 to 53 in the second month. In the 3rd month, I gained new visitors 158 with return visitors 80. The below graph illustrates the positive outcome of new and returning visitors.

               ## For the Pessimistic model, I assumed that my new visitors would increase by 5% per month, and in the returning users I assumed it would be 40% per month and 15% of Non-bounced new visitors would be returning (after taking the bounce rate from the sessions). From the graph below, we can see that new visitors have increased from 120 to 126 and returning visitors from 30 to 36 in the second month. In the 3rd month, I gained new visitors 133 with returning visitors 41. Pessimistic is the scenario where we are unable to make it up to the customer or the website has some issues. So, in order to avoid this, we must take measures and take feedback from the user. Below graph depicts the Pessimistic Forecasting model.

In conclusion, for a better understanding of the profitability of my website, I have calculated the monetary worth of each visitor (both new and returning visitors). In both the new and returning users we have monetarized them each with $2. Based on the analysis I have concluded that chasing new visitors is worth more also it is quite important to retain returning users and I have given $3 per session and $1 per page view (I have pageviews of 1,589) and download is $4(current downloads are 20) and submission ($10 per form), and at last $20 per three-page funnel completion is of how many users have visited all the sites and reaching the end of the site. Currently, my site is worth around $3,498 per month, to understand the future scope of the website and for updating purposes I have mentioned all three forecasting models in the below graph.

## Conclusion:
In the Final analysis, I have taken all models for three months, In the first month, I have current data and the website is worth ~ $3,989. Although we have new users every month, we must keep good relationships with our Returning users. In order to maintain that we have to update our site according to the preference of the user.
